           <p>Two Sides of Smart Phones</p>
            <p></p>
            
            <p>With the development of modern technology and the improvement of our living standard, smart phones are available to many of us. In fact, they have become indispensable to our daily contact with others. <br>
No sensible man will deny that smart phones provide us with easy access to various sources of information and a new platform to convey ideas and make friends. However, it might give rise to some problems as well. For example, spending too much time using smart phones with little face-to-face communication with others might isolate users from the society, which might make them socially inadequate. Also, in a sedentary society, staring at smart phones with few physical exercises will be physically detrimental to users. <br>
In my view, smart phones make it easy for people to show their ideas and exchange personal experiences. However, people should adjust the time and avoid spending too much time on smart phones. After all, being addicted to smart phones does harm both to their health and mind.
