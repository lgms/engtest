           <p>Say No to Jaywalking</p>
            <p>
</p>
            
            <p>No one will fail to notice the fact that nowadays jaywalking has turned from an illegal practice into a commonplace one in many cities of our country. According to a recent poll, more than 80% of the people surveyed admitted they had once done so. What are some of the factors involved and measures we should take to cope with this problem?<br>
Jaywalking originates from a general slackening of self-discipline with everyday behavior. Many citizens regard it as a minor issue and have no idea that it is actually against the traffic law. Meanwhile, the laws and regulations are far from being fully observed in a practical sense. All these lead to the frequent occurrence of jaywalking. <br>
	Jaywalking is far from a minor bad habit but a fact forbidden by law, so the offenders should be punished when they are caught. However, it is my own personal view that prevention is better than cure and so a good education program about the observation of traffic regulation is one of the most important steps any government should take.
